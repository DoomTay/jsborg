# jsborg
JavaScript reader and explorer for CYBERWORLD QBORGs

This project makes use of [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako).

The [main viewer](qborgprototype.html) only works with local files, and depends on a hardcoded path defined at the top of [qborg.js](qborg.js).

The structure of relevant files were discovered through trial and error from experimenting with outputs of [CYBERWORLD's authoring tools](http://web.archive.org/web/20030204221240/http://www.cwarp.com:80/downloads/index.html)
